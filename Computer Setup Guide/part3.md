# How to install node:
### we will install Node.js using nvm ( Node Version Manager )
- run this command to install Node Version Manager: ( it will take up to ~ <img height="40px" width="30px" src="images/Time.png" alt="update your windows now"> 6 mins)

```
brew install nvm
```
- once it's done, we need to `CLOSE UBUNTU` and re-open it again in order to take effect

- Now run this command to install Node: ( This will install the latest stable version of Node.js) ( it will take up to ~ <img height="40px" width="30px" src="images/Time.png" alt="update your windows now"> 4 mins )

```
nvm install --lts
```
- let's check the node version by running this command:
```
nvm ls
```
- you should see a result similar to this ( v14.17.3 or higher! )

- let's double check the node version by running this command:
```
node --version
```
- the output should be only the node version 
- in our case it's `v14.17.3` ( it's ok if you get higher version )

```
```
git config --global init.defaultbranch main
```

- let's make sure that all the settings are correct by running this command:
```
git config --list
